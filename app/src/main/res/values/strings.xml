        \n
        <b>Q2. What is the work of hall secretaries(mess secretary, maintenance secretary etc) and how they are selected and what if they dont turn up to their promises?</b> \n
        Ans: Hall secreatries have the responsibility of maintaining decorum and harmony among the hall boarders inside the hall premises. They act as link between the warden, chief warden and the students and manage the hall affais and facilities to ensure a smooth stay of the boarders.
        \n \nAs the names suggest the mess secretary decides the Mess Menu as per everones needs, environment secretary is concerned with the cleanliness issues in the hall, sports secretary takes care of the sports activities in the hall or among the halls(including intra and inter hall competitions) and keep track of all sports equipments of the hall, the general secretary manages all the hall activities(like Hall Day, garden fest) and supervises the work of other secretaries, cultural secretary works towards promoting cultural events in hall or among halls through competitions like Rangoli, face painting, T-shirt designing etc.
        \n \nAll the secretaries are selected based on hall election results date and time of which are suitably notified to boarders/students through webmail and announcement. In case any of the post holders doesnot turn up to his/her duties well or students have any complaints against him/her they can submit a complaint letter in the warden office in suitable hours specifying the reason for the same.
        \n \n <b>Q3. What is the procedure to change the room after first year?</b> \n
        Ans: Generally students are alloted double seated rooms after their first year i.e. during their 3rd semester. So students desiring to get a specific room in a specific hostel/hall of residence need to form a group of their group of 2 or 3 or more(depending on number of students in their friend circle wanting to get room in same block or nearby or in same hall) and suitably send a letter (specifying their names and roll no. along with the details of the hall and room they want) to the Chief Warden and submit it in his office in working hours. If a student doesnot have a group or doesnot send any letter to the Chief Warden office for the same then he/she would be randomly alloted a hall and room based on availability and NITR Room Alottment Policy.
